# TelloDroneOpenCV
Example code using Tello drone and openCv to see video and control flight using keyboard

Install OpenCV on your windows desktop using "pip install opencv-python"
Add the package to your pycharm project

Opening a window is simple in OpenCV and capturing keypresses. Give the window and the streaming video a chance to catch up though so basically when you run the program wait on the video to come through
